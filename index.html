        <p>
            This is a small network operated by Guy. I'm a devops engineer and IPv6 enthusiast based in High Wycombe, United Kingdom. Most network traffic will come from my homelab, and a few VLANs of my home network setup.

        Why

    <section>
        <p>
            Why manage my own network? Mainly because I find it fun. As a person working in Platform/Devops engineering, I get to play with a lot of technologies as part of my work. However, networking usually isn't one of them. So I do it as a hobby in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, IPv6 implementation in the UK is very much lacking, with many ISPs relying on CG-NAT to extend the use of IPv4 since the global exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.

            In general I maintain an open peering policy and peer at physical IXPs.
            Check out <a href="https://peerwith.me/199109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PeeringDB</a> for detailed and up-to-date information.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently have a peering presence at the following IXPs:
            <ul>
                <li>FogIXP (Frankfurt, Germany)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are interested in peering, please send an email to <a href="mailto:noc@as199109.net">noc@as199109.net</a>.

            Some parts of the network will be named "Guy Newbury" and other parts "Guy Fenn-Newbury". This is because I have recently married and changed my name. However, they both refer to the same network.

            I owe a lot of my knowledge to the <a href="https://discord.gg/ipv6">IPv6 Discord group</a>, who have helped guide me in setting up my ASN, getting prefix allocations, and getting IXP peering and transit set up. Without them, I would still be fumbling about with tunnelbrokers.

            Additionally, this site layout was designed by Hazel Reimer, who created it for <a href="https://as200242.net">Hazelnet (AS200242)</a>. She has very kindly let me use it for my site.
